# Vehicle Telematics and Over-The-Air Firmware Updates with ESP32

## Introduction

Welcome to this innovative project that intersects the fields of Vehicle Telematics, Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates, and a WebSocket server. As a passionate developer and an integral part of an autonomous driving startup, I am excited to share this detailed project. The idea behind this project is to tap into the potential of the ESP32 microcontroller, providing an interactive, real-time experience for managing and securing modern vehicles.

## Project Overview

This project combines the complex world of vehicle diagnostics, real-time data communication, and firmware updates. By interfacing the ESP32 with a vehicle's 16-pin DLC connector, the project can retrieve an array of vehicle data and stream this information in real-time. The ESP32 also serves as an Access Point (AP), creating a network for client devices to join. A WebSocket server on the ESP32 ensures real-time, bidirectional communication between the ESP32 and the connected client devices.

To ensure that the ESP32 is always up-to-date with the latest features and improvements, Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates have been implemented, reducing the need for physical interactions and streamlining the update process.

## How to Use

The ESP32 retrieves OBD2 data from the vehicle's ECU and makes it accessible to connected clients. To visualize this data, connect a device to the ESP32's AP and access the web page it serves. Here, you'll see real-time OBD2 data.

To implement the solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Replace the placeholders in the code with your credentials.
3. Upload the firmware to your ESP32.
4. Connect your ESP32 to your vehicle's OBD2 interface.
5. If there's new firmware that you developed, save it as "fw.bin" and replace the current "fw.bin" in the git
6. Replace the text reflecting your new version in the "bin-version.txt" file
7. Reset your ESP32 by pressing the Enable (EN) button

## System Details

**OBD-II Diagnostics:** On-Board Diagnostic Systems (OBD-II) provide access to the status and data of various vehicle subsystems. By interfacing the ESP32 with the vehicle's OBD-II system, the device can harness this data, enabling an in-depth analysis of the vehicle's state and performance.

**OTA Firmware Update:** The system incorporates Over-The-Air firmware updates using the ESP32’s Wi-Fi capabilities. This allows remote updating of the device’s software, ensuring it's always up-to-date with the latest features and improvements.

**WebSocket Server:** The ESP32 also serves as a WebSocket server, enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the ESP32 and any connected clients. This ensures a real-time data feed from the vehicle, paving the way for dynamic, responsive vehicle management.

## Future Application and Potential

While this project in its current form serves as an exploration into the realms of vehicle telematics and remote updates, it is also a crucial building block for a larger objective in the startup I am part of. Here's a glance at the future plans:

**Anti-Theft Mechanism:** One of the future enhancements planned is an innovative anti-theft solution. This will entail a specific sequence of actions that must be performed before the vehicle can be operated normally. For instance, turning the left blinker on twice, followed by the hazard light once, could act as an action sequence password. If this sequence is not performed correctly, the system will trigger certain responses (such as flashing headlights or honking the horn) after a short period of normal operation, alerting surroundings of the potential unauthorized use.

## End Goal and Applications

While this project is a great exploration into vehicle telematics and security, it also serves a more significant purpose for the startup I am part of. Here's how:

1. **Advanced Fleet Management:** The real-time vehicle data and communication capability make this project an excellent tool for fleet management. As the startup progresses towards a broader fleet of autonomous vehicles, this technology will prove instrumental.

2. **Scalable Anti-Theft Solution:** The unique action sequence password provides an added layer of security, crucial as the number of vehicles in the fleet grows.

3. **Integration with Autonomous Driving:** This project aligns perfectly with our startup's mission of enabling level 2 autonomous driving. It not only provides crucial vehicle data but also offers features that will become more important as vehicles become more autonomous.

This project signifies a crucial step in autonomous vehicle technology, particularly in vehicle management and security. I invite you to explore the code, understand the mechanisms, and perhaps even contribute to this ongoing journey to make autonomous vehicles safer and more secure. Your feedback and collaboration are greatly appreciated!
